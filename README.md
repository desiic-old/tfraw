# TensorFlow Raw Library

This library utilises TensorFlow Raw (Python) instead of TensorFlow Keras or TensorFlow Estimator to facilitate the use of low-level features. TFRaw utilises low-level features of TensorFlow but provides simple APIs which would be as easy to use as possible. Fits for everybody. TFRaw is mainly used in the Fadev.AI project but general public use is warmly welcome.
